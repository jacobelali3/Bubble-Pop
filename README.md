# Bubble-Pop
IOS App to pop bubbles and score points. The UI was built with storyboard, programmed in swift 5.

It spawns bubbles every X seconds (set by difficulty level) and then the user 'Pops' them by tapping them.

The user scores as many 'points' as they can within the time limit. It will then rank their score against other users of different names.

It can save the users name, settings (difficulty, number of bubbles per spawn, size of bubbles, timer) and score.

I've made sure the program fits in almost all apple devices as of May 2022.

Im not sure why Storyboard considers the height of an iphone 4 to be 'Regular' and not 'Compact'. That was kind of annoying.


## Steps to run 
Double click Bubble Pop.xcodeproj. 'Build and play' with any simulator on Xcode.
